# How to install Kerbal Star Systems

1. Start with a clean 1.11 or 1.12 KSP version. 
2. Download [Kopernicus](https://github.com/kopernicus/kopernicus/releases). Make sure your KSP version matches.
3. Download [GU_Core](https://github.com/StarCrusher96/Galaxies-Unbound-A-Stellar-Odyssey/releases). You always need GU_Core as the basic structure. You'll have to add Kerbal Star Systems on top.
4. Drop the 'GU'-folder in your GameData-folder.

# How to install Galaxies Unbound: Visuals

  → When using visual mods, no need to worry! KSS is now able to enable visuals on its own. Just download [Eve-Redux/Eve](https://github.com/LGhassen/EnvironmentalVisualEnhancements/releases/) and/-or [Scatterer](https://github.com/LGhassen/Scatterer/releases).


# How to use the HOMESWITCH mode.

  → All explained in the [GU Installation guide](https://github.com/StarCrusher96/Galaxies-Unbound-A-Stellar-Odyssey).


# AFTER launching the game. (!important!)

1. You need Texture quality at its highest setting. Otherwise a few worlds will spawn as black orbs.

# A MINOR ISSUE that might happen with the latest scatterer.

1. Sometimes after loading the game twice (as you must for a homeswitch), the body that represents your homeworld, looks like this:

2. To fix this, remove the ScattererAtmosphereCache -folder (in GameData) and restart the game.



--- After you followed these steps and the game loaded without errors, you should be able to add more mods.
--- This should be all to get Kerbal Star Systems working! ENJOY!
